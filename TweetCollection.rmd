```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

POC
```{r}
library(rtweet)
trump <- get_timeline("realDonaldTrump", n = 180)
```
the tweet collection gives us 90 different variables. Surely we dont need all of that so we are gonna cherry pick the most interesting ones
```{r}
toKeep <- c("screen_name", "text", "is_retweet")
trump <- trump[names(trump) %in% toKeep]
```
