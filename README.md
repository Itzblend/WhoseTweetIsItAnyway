# WhoseTweetIsItAnyway

In this project I delve into NLP (Natural Language Processing).

I wanted to learn wheter I could make an algorithm that knows from which parlament party a tweet came from, judging only the text in the tweet.

The project pipeline goes as follows:

#### Data collection -> Data cleaning -> Tokenization -> Document term matrix & Vocabulary building -> TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency -> Normalization -> Fitting the model -> Predicting the values

### The final prediction accuracy was 75%
For a raw text data I consider this to be pretty accurate.
